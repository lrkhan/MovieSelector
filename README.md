# MovieSelector
CLI Python3 program that reads a file of movie names and watched movie names then rolls for random movie that hasn't been watched.

The movie list included in the repo is based on a "Top 100 Movies" poster and a quick search of top 100 movies on IMDB.

Some international movies are specified and movies on the list with [N/A] indicates movies that are not on the poster.

Three text files are included in the repo. The program utilizes "movies.txt" and "watched.txt". "originalmovielist.txt" was included as a back up for "movies.txt" just incase an error occurs in the program and the textfiles display incorrect information.
